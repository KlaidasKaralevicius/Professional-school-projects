    <p>Ramen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodles. One theory says that ramen was first
    introduced to Japan during the 1660s by the Chinese neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui who served as an advisor to
    Tokugawa Mitsukuni after he became a refugee in Japan to escape Manchu rule and Mitsukuni became the first Japanese
    person to eat ramen, although most historians reject this theory as a myth created by the Japanese to embellish the
    origins of ramen. The more plausible theory is that ramen was introduced by Chinese immigrants in the late
    19th or early 20th century at Yokohama Chinatown. According to the record of the Yokohama Ramen Museum,
    ramen originated in China and made its way over to Japan in 1859. Early versions were wheat noodles in broth topped
    with Chinese-style roast pork.Ramen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodles. One theory says that ramen was first
