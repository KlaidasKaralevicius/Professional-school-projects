    <p>The myths and legends of Scotland have a "local colour" as they tell about the way of life during the olden
        times, apart
        from giving a perspective of the nature of the country during various seasons of the year. It was the belief
        that Beira,
        the Queen of Winter, had a firm hold on the country by raising storms during January and February thus
        preventing
        greenery to emerge. She was considered a tough and brutal old woman who stirred the deadly spiraling action of
        Corryvreckan, ushering snow, as well as torrents resulting in the overflow of rivers. Even the creation of lochs
        and
        mountains were attributed to her.</p>
    <p>Scottish mythology is not like the Greek and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_mythology"
            target="_blank">Roman myths</a> as it deals with
        various aspects of nature. In this context the most powerful and feared goddess representing winter is Beira who
        rules
        winter for its entire duration. On Beltane she readily concedes to Brighid, who enjoys power until Samhain. This
        myth is
        akin to the popular myth of the Mayans and deals with female power in the "creation and the cycle of the year".
        However,
        Donald Mackenzie in his book Scottish Wonder Tales from Myth and Legend states that the goddesses of the
        Scottish myths
        are not glorified, very much unlike the goddesses of ancient Greece.
        The rivers in Scotland were considered the dwelling places of goddesses with their characteristic denoting the
        nature of
        the river, such as the River Forth being called "deaf or soundless river" on account of its silent flow
        conditions, and
        the River Clyde called as "the purifying river" as it caused scouring and cleansing, carrying "mud and clay"
        during the
        flood season.</p>
    <h4>As Hags</h4>
    <img style="width: 37%;" src="images/Lightmatter_cliffs.jpg" alt="Lightmatter cliffs">
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_deities" target="_blank">Celtic goddesses </a>were
        authoritative and were associated with
        female fertility as related to female divinity and earth. In olden times the
        Celtics land and national societies were both linked with the body of the goddess (also attributed as "tribal
        goddess")
        and her representative on earth was the queen. Another "ambivalent" character in Scottish myths was the "hag",
        the
        Goddess, the Gaelic Cailleach, and the Giantess, a divine being who is harmful. The hag is also considered a
        "healer"
        and helpful during childbirth and is divine and said to have "long ancestry and incredible longevity". She is
        also known
        as "at once creator and destroyer, gentle and fierce, mother and nurturer".</p>

    <p>Several origin legends for the Scots arose during the historical period, serving various purposes.</p>
    <p>One Scottish origin legend, or pseudo-historical account of the foundation of the Scottish people, appears in
        adapted
        form in the tenth-century Latin Life of St. Cathróe of Metz. It relates that settlers from Greek Asia Minor
        sailed the
        seas and arrived at Cruachan Feli <strong>"the mountain of Ireland"</strong>, probably for Cruachan Éli (Croagh
        Patrick, Co. Mayo), a
        well-known place in Hiberno-Latin hagiography since Tírechán's Collectanea. As they roamed through Ireland, from
        Clonmacnoise, Armagh and Kildare to Cork, and finally, to Bangor, they were continually engaged at war with the
        Pictanei. After some time, they crossed the Irish Sea to invade Caledonia North of Roman Britain, successively
        capturing
        Iona, the cities of Rigmhonath and Bellathor in the process. <em>The latter places are echoed by the appearance
            of
            Cinnrígmonaid and Cinnbelathoir in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</em>. The territory so conquered was
        then named Scotia
        after Scota, the Egyptian wife of Spartan commander Nél or Niul, and St. <u>Patrick converted the people to
            Christianity.<sup>1</sup></u></p>
    <p>Once the Picts adopted Gaelic culture and their actual characteristics faded out of memory, folkloric elements
        filled
        the gaps of history. Their "<del>sudden</del> disappearance" was explained as a slaughter happening at a banquet
        given by Kenneth
        MacAlpin (an international folklore motif) and they were ascribed with powers like those of the fairies, brewing
        heather
        from secret recipes and living in underground chambers. In the eighteenth century the Picts were co-opted as a
        "Germanic" race.<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>In the Celtic domains of Scotland, also known as <mark>Gàidhealtachd</mark>, there were ancient pre-Christian
        structures. In the
        farthest end of northwest Scotland there are standing stones at Callanish on the Isle of Lewis, in a vertical
        position,
        which are akin to the Stonehenge; these are believed to be older than Stonehenge and are standing for more than
        5000
        years and said to be denoting sun worship.</p>

    <hr>
    <img style="width: 32%;" src="images/cuchulain.jpg" alt="Cuchulain">
    <p><em>Because of the movement of people from Ulster to west Scotland, which resulted in close linguistic links
            between Ulster
            and the west of Scotland, much of <strong>Gaelic mythology was imported to Scotland</strong>, and possibly
            some of it was written in
            Scotland. The Ulster Cycle, set around the beginning of the Christian era, consists of a group of heroic
            stories dealing
            with the lives of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, the great hero Cúchulainn, and of their friends,
            lovers, and
            enemies. These are the Ulaid, or people of the North-Eastern corner of Ireland and the action of the stories
            centres
            round the royal court at Emain Macha, close to the modern city of Armagh. The Ulaid had close links with
            Gaelic
            Scotland, where Cúchulainn is said to have learned the arts of war.</em></p>
    <p><u>The cycle consists of stories of the births, early lives and training, wooings, battles, feastings and deaths
            of the
            heroes and reflects a warrior society in which warfare consists mainly of single combats and wealth is
            measured mainly
            in cattle.</u> These stories are written for the most part in prose. The centrepiece of the Ulster Cycle is
        the Táin Bó
        Cúailnge. Other important Ulster Cycle tales include The Tragic Death of Aife's only Son, Fled Bricrenn
        "Bricriu's
        Feast", and Togail Bruidne Dá Derga "The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel". This cycle is, in some respects,
        close to
        the mythological cycle of the rest of the Gaelic speaking world. Some characters from the latter reappear, and
        the same
        sort of shape-shifting magic is much in evidence, side by side with a grim, almost callous realism. While it may
        be
        supposed that a few characters, such as Medb or Cú Roí, of once being deities, and Cúchulainn in particular
        displays
        superhuman prowess, the characters are firmly mortal and rooted in a specific time and place. Scottish Gaelic
        adaptations of Ulster Cycle tales appear in the Glenmasan manuscript.<sup>3</sup></p>
