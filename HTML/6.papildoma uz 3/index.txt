        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web
            pages. HTML was
            created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was
            published in
            1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is
            widely used
            but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was
            published in 2012.</p><br>
